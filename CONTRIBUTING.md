### Customization Notes:
- If you are going to start an Incogine project, Replace **Incogine** with the name of your project in `src/project.xml` at the key `name`.
- The key `incogine_version` at `src/project.xml` should not be modified by you, updating the base's source code will update that key's value.
- If you have a separate Code of Conduct, link to it.
